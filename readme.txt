Simplified press release and media coverage management for corporate websites.

== Description ==

The Nooz WordPress plugin simplifies management of your press releases and media coverage content. It adds custom post
types along with carefully crafted settings, giving you the flexibility needed to manage your corporate news section.

Upon installing the plugin, you will be prompted to create an initial set of pages needed to manage your news section:

**/news/**
The default news page shows the latest 5 (configurable) press releases and press coverage items.

**/news/press-releases/**
The press releases page shows all available press releases

**/news/press-coverage/**
The press coverage page shows all available press coverage (these are links to external press articles/coverage).

The plugin also exposes the following shortcodes: '[nooz-release]' and '[nooz-coverage]'. These shortcodes allow you to
insert press release and press coverage lists on a page.

= Coming soon =
* Fine-grained control when editing a press release
